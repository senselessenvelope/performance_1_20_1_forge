## How to set up scripts
To use these scripts, navigate to your Minecraft instance folder (in ATLauncher, click Open Folder option of instance) and pull the contents of this repo. 

This will create a subfolder with the repo contents.

Just drag the contents of that subfolder back into the main instance folder so it looks like this. Make sure to ALSO DRAG THE .gitignore !!!

And now delete that repo folder.

So you now have these.

Now this entire folder will be recognised as a Git repo. Make sure to KEEP THE .gitignore !!!
