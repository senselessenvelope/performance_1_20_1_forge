## How to install instance
To install instance, pull repo first

Then, import instance in ATLauncher

Name it whatever you want with whatever description. You will need to customise your own RAM, settings, keybinds, and so on within ATLauncher. 
Set up scripts below and test them in a new world to get started!


## How to set up scripts
To use these scripts, navigate to your Minecraft instance folder (in ATLauncher, click Open Folder option of instance) and pull the contents of this repo. 
IF ALREADY PULLED FROM ABOVE, just follow along using those repo contents EXCEPT for instance.zip.

This will create a subfolder with the repo contents.

Just drag the contents of that subfolder (EXCEPT instance.zip) back into the main instance folder so it looks like this. Make sure to ALSO DRAG .gitignore !!!

And now delete that repo folder.

So you now have these.

Now this entire folder will be recognised as a Git repo. Make sure to KEEP .gitignore !!!
